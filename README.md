# Mysql
Mysql was downloaded in ubuntu 
I used ls to list the files making sure the filename is listed
Mysql was then installed using sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config* in order to add repositories
sudo apt install mysql-server was used to install the latest MySql server package
I used sudo systemctl status mysql to check the activeness of Mysql
The status of Mysql was tested using mysqladmin -u root -p version
Mysql is successfully installed and running.
